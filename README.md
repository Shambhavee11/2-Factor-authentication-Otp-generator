# 2-Factor-authentication-Otp-generator
Build a Otp generator for Two Step Authentication using combination of TOTP and HOTP . TOTP provides time-based  one-time passwords, while HOTP provides counter-based one-time passwords. Combining these mechanisms can enhance security by requiring users to provide both a time-based and a counter-based OTP for authentication.
